# Crop_Recommendation_System
The inefficiency in crop selection faced by farmers is due to inadequate consideration of soil characteristics and environmental conditions. Traditional methods rely heavily on subjective judgment, often leading to suboptimal outcomes such as reduced yields and economic losses. To address this, a Crop Recommendation System (CRS) is proposed, leveraging data analytics to provide personalized crop recommendations based on user-input parameters including soil nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. By developing an accurate and user-friendly CRS, we aim to empower farmers with data-driven insights to optimize crop selection, enhance agricultural productivity, and promote sustainable farming practices, thereby contributing to food security and socio-economic development in rural areas.
